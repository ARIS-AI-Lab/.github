# Welcome to ARIS Lab: Advanced Robotics and Intelligent Surgery at CWRU! ðŸ¤–ðŸ§  

Our research lab is focused on transforming the landscape of modern surgery by integrating advanced robotics, computer vision, and artificial intelligence. We aim to develop intelligent surgical systems capable of perception, decision-making, and precise control in complex clinical environments. Our core research areas include image-guided robotic surgery, surgical scene understanding, tool tracking, skill assessment, and reinforcement learning for robot-assisted interventions. At ARIS Lab, we are committed to advancing the frontiers of intelligent surgical robotics to enable safer, smarter, and more autonomous healthcare solutions.
